# Evaluate a News Article with Natural Language Processing


    Here is an example of a basic but functional app built on Express and Webpack.
    Sentiment Analysis is MeaningCloud's solution for performing a detailed multilingual sentiment analysis of texts from different sources.

    The text provided is analyzed to determine if it expresses a positive/negative/neutral sentiment; to do this, the local polarity of the different sentences in the text is identified and the relationship between them evaluated, resulting in a global polarity value for the whole text.

## The following is a list of the courses that might help in creating the project:

- C1 - Intro to Build Tools
- C2 - Basics of Webpack
- C3 - Sass and Webpack
